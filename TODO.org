* TODO [#A] Feature :: Shelves

By setting =:shelf:= in the properties drawer, you should be able
to tag the text so that they can be accessed through a special route.

Example:

#+begin_src org
 * Some writing
  :PROPERTIES:
  :shelf:    ideas
  :END:

Writing...
#+end_src

Then the text would become available under routes like:

#+begin_src ruby
get '/:shelf/:id'
get '/api/shelves/:shelf.json'
#+end_src

After the text is created, the =:_id:= attribute is appended to the text,
so that it can be updated.

#+begin_src org
 * Some writing
  :PROPERTIES:
  :_id:      98128912981289
  :shelf:    ideas
  :END:

Writing updated...
#+end_src

* TODO Feature :: Blog shelf

This would create a route like:

#+begin_src ruby
get '/blog/:year/:month/:day/:slug'
#+end_src

which could be used to have something similar to a blog.
In order for a text to be part of this shelf in needs to have 
the following attributes in the properties drawer.

#+begin_src org
 * Hello world
  :PROPERTIES:
  :id:       1
  :slug:     hello-world
  :shelf:    blog
  :public:   yes
  :END:

  Example blog post
#+end_src

* TODO Feature :: Bookmarks shelf

This is a special shelf that makes a list of links a-la HN.

#+begin_src org
 * Interesting link
  :PROPERTIES:
  :shelf:    bookmarks
  :END:

#+end_src

These can be later browsed through the route:

#+begin_src ruby
get '/bookmarks/:id'
#+end_src
